# Xing Challenge

* Git directory is included into the zip. I think is enough to see the commit history.
* For reactive programming, I have used the RxJava2 library. It was my first experience with it. I hope it is ok.
* For the api call, I have used Retrofit2  approach becouse fits quite well with reactive programing. A no-libs approach is not difficult to implement, but I wanted to experience.
* My solution for persistence storage is with SharedPreferences. It is not a good solution for bigger application, but enough for this case.
* I've noticed I have a bug with the persistence approach when load the last data... but I have no time to fix it.

I've really enjoyed coding this challenge. I hope you enjoy too reading my solution.
